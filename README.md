# AcadMal
This game teaches players about academic malpractice and how to avoid it through a series of scenarios presented in a "visual novel" style.

# Playing the Game

You can play the full game [online](https://frederikse.itch.io/academic-malpractice).

There is also an ["embedded" version](https://eigenedateien.github.io/personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/stuart.anderson/projects/eps_malpractice_courses/writing/index.html) which uses an existing course to introduce the concepts and drops into the game for illustrative sceanrios.

You can also download the game and run it in [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org).

# Getting started

Download the latest version of the [Ren'Py SDK](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html).

Clone or download this repository. You should end up with a top level directory with a helpful name (e.g., `acadmal`) which contains the `game` directory.

You can put this in the Ren'Py SDK directory and it will be recognised by the Launcher, or open the Launcher and set the preferences for the project directory to the parent of your game.

You should now be able to run the game from the launcher. (You might need to hit "refresh").
